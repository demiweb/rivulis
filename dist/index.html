                            From the first meter of pipe in 1966, with slow and labor intensive production, we took
                            the
                            first step towards drip irrigation as the world knows it today. Israel flourished and
                            with
                            significant investment and innovation so did our production.

                            The Plastro R&D team set themselves the task of developing a dripper that emitted the
                            same
                            amount of water, even with fluctuating pressures within the tube.

                        <p>
                            In 1979 they got their breakthrough. The very first Plastro PC dripper - the PLASTIF -
                            incorporated a membrane to regulate a constant flow of water. Now farmers could irrigate
                            on
                            sloping ground and with longer row lengths using drip technology.

                            The 1970s saw drip irrigation becoming more commonplace, but it wasn’t without its
                            challenges. Water distribution in long crop rows or sloping ground was uneven.

                            Wind machines, helicopters and heaters all offer active frost protection, but they can
                            be
                            expensive and dependent on availability. A micro sprinkler and sprinkler system is a
                            simple,
                            cost effective way to significantly decrease frost damage. It’s all about physics. micro
                            sprinklers and sprinklers help prevent the soil surface from dropping below the freezing
                            point, and in addition, create ‘clear ice’ on the plants, where latent heat is released
                            which keeps the warmth of the plant inside it. There are two ways to design your
                            sprinkler
                            system – under canopy or over canopy. Rivulis is here to help you every step of the way
                            and
                            design the right frost protection system for your unique needs.
